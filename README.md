# Introduciton 

This repository contains MEGAlib simulations for both AMEGO and AMEGO-X, which are proposed next-generation gamma-ray telescopes. 
The directories **GRB170817A** and **Simulation_Challenge** are
general tutorials for using MEGAlib. The directory **TXS_0506+056** contains simulations corresponding
to the neurtino events detected by IceCube. This directory also contains all the code for the MEGAlib python module, applied in this case to the source TXS 0506+056 using AMEGO.

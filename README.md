# Introduciton 

This repository contains MEGAlib simulations for both AMEGO and AMEGO-X, which are proposed next-generation gamma-ray telescopes. 
The directories **GRB170817A** and **Simulation_Challenge** are
general tutorials for using MEGAlib. The directory **TXS_0506+056** contains simulations corresponding
to the neurtino events detected by IceCube. This directory also contains code for the MEGAlib python module.

# Analysis Outline <br />
One of the primary software tools used for designing future MeV Telescopes is MEGAlib, available [here](http://megalibtoolkit.com/home.html). MEGAlib simulates the emission from any gamma-ray source, simulates the instrument response, and generates the simulated data that would be detected for a given detector design, observation time, background emission, etc. See the above link for more details regarding the MEGAlib package. 

This repository contains code for generating the main input for simulating a source in MEGAlib, as well as code for processing the simulated data. 

## Summary of the Module <br />
The main output is shown below:

# Analysis Outline <br />
The diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galaxy arises primarily from the interaction of high-energy cosmic rays (CR) with the interstellar gas and radiation fields.
Of particular interest in this analysis is the gas-related emission, which is due to CR protons interacting with the protons
of the gas, which generates pions, that then quickly decays to gamma-ray photons. The gas is made up primarily of atomic hydrogen (HI), molecular hydrogen (H2), 
and so-called dark gas. The method developed in this analysis pertains to H2 in particular; however, it can be easily generalized to any of the gas components.
